                <h1> ABOUT LAZER EFFECT </h1>
                <p>
                    <i><strong>Lazer Effect</strong> is more than just a beanie brand</i> — it’s a movement born from
                    ambition,
                    creativity, and style.
                    Specialising in skull cap beanies, we craft pieces that are simple yet bold, versatile yet
                    expressive.
                    Whether it’s for the streets, the skate park, or everyday wear, our beanies are designed to be the
                    finishing
                    touch that makes your look stand out.

                    <br> <br>

                    Built on authenticity and self-expression, Lazer Effect speaks to those who aren’t afraid to make
                    their
                    own
                    statement. Each piece reflects the brand’s core values: originality, confidence, and a drive to push
                    boundaries. What started as a small local project has quickly become a brand with big <i>vision</i>
                    —
                    redefining
                    what it means to wear your individuality with pride.

                <h1> OUR STORY </h1>
                <p>
                    Founded by <b>Trevor Gathiga</b> straight out of high school, Lazer Effect began with nothing more
                    than
                    a
                    dream and a few skull caps. Trevor saw an opportunity to create headwear that combined style with
                    identity,
                    and he turned his passion into a brand that resonates with young people everywhere.

                    <br> <br>

                    Selling his first skullies locally, shaping Lazer Effect into a rising name in streetwear, Trevor’s
                    journey is one of resilience and creativity. Today, the brand continues to grow with the same energy
                    it
                    started with: fearless, innovative, and dedicated to giving every customer more than just a product
                    —
                    but a
                    lifestyle.
